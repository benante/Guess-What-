## In House Project

In House Project is an exciting game that merges the creativity of Pictionary with the unpredictable twists of Chinese Whispers.

## How it Works

**Prompting:** The game kicks off with the first player providing a mysterious prompt. It could be anything from a word, phrase, or even a quirky idea.

**Drawing:** The prompt is then passed to the next player, who translates it into a captivating masterpiece through drawing.

**Guessing:** Now, it's the third player's turn to step into the world of imagination. They must decipher the original prompt solely based on the artwork created.

**Result:** At the end of the game, everyone gets to experience the grand reveal! Witness the magic as the original prompts are unveiled alongside the beautiful artworks they inspired.
